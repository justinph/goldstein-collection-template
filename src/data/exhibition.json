    "description": "The Lounge Chair and Ottoman is the culmination of Charles and Ray Eames' efforts to create comfortable and handsome lounge seating using production techniques that combined the technology they developed for plywood molding with hand craftsmanship. Charles Eames said his goal for The Lounge Chair was the \"warm, receptive look of a well-used first baseman's mitt.\" The first Lounge Chair and Ottoman, produced in 1956, was a birthday gift for friend Billy Wilder, the Academy Award-winning film director, and it made its public debut on Arlene Francis' Home Show, forerunner of the Today show. Awarded the Milan Triennial prize in 1957, the Lounge Chair quickly became a popular and costly status symbol, an icon of the 1960s and 1970s that represented success and good taste.",
